## scope

Extracts formal requirements from spec files, producing user stories and TDD anchors.

### When to Use

- Starting a new feature
- Analyzing requirements
- Setting up test coverage targets

### Input

- Spec file (`.ldf/specs/*.yaml`)

### Output

- User stories (`.ldf/sail/scope/user-stories.yaml`)
- TDD anchors (`.ldf/sail/scope/tdd-anchors.yaml`)

### Command

```bash
ldf crew dispatch scope
ldf crew dispatch scope --spec my-feature
```

### Example Output

```yaml
# user-stories.yaml
stories:
  - id: US-001
    title: User Registration
    as_a: new user
    i_want: to create an account
    so_that: I can access the application
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Email validation
      - Password strength check
    priority: high
```

---

## architect

Designs technical architecture based on requirements and existing codebase patterns.

### When to Use

- After scope phase
- Designing new systems
- Planning component structure

### Input

- Spec file
- Scope outputs (user stories, anchors)
- Existing codebase (for pattern matching)

### Output

- Design document (`.ldf/sail/architect/design.md`)
- Component specs (`.ldf/sail/architect/components.yaml`)
- Decision records (`.ldf/sail/architect/decisions.yaml`)

### Command

```bash
ldf crew dispatch architect
ldf crew dispatch architect --reasoning high
```

### Configuration

```yaml
# .ldf/settings.yaml
crew:
  members:
    architect:
      reasoning: high
      include_diagrams: true
      analyze_existing: true
```

---

## coder

Generates implementation code based on architect specifications.

### When to Use

- After architect phase
- Implementing new features
- Generating boilerplate

### Input

- Spec file
- Architect outputs (components, design)
- Scope outputs (for context)
- Existing code patterns

### Output

- Source files in target locations
- Type definitions
- Inline documentation

### Command

```bash
ldf crew dispatch coder
ldf crew dispatch coder --reasoning high --max-tokens 32000
```

### Configuration

```yaml
crew:
  members:
    coder:
      reasoning: high
      max_tokens: 32000
      temperature: 0.7
      # Generate multiple files in one dispatch
      multi_file: true
      # Include inline documentation
      include_docs: true
```

### Best Practices

<Aside type="tip">
Use `--reasoning high` for complex logic like algorithms or state management. Use `medium` for standard CRUD operations.
</Aside>

## tester

Generates tests based on TDD anchors and implementation code.

### When to Use

- After coder generates implementation
- Improving test coverage
- Writing tests for existing code

### Input

- TDD anchors
- Implementation code
- Existing test patterns

### Output

- Unit tests (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)
- Integration tests
- Test fixtures and mocks

### Command

```bash
ldf crew dispatch tester
ldf crew dispatch tester --types unit,integration
```

### Configuration

```yaml
crew:
  members:
    tester:
      reasoning: medium
      # Test types to generate
      types:
        - unit
        - integration
      # Use existing test patterns
      match_patterns: true
      # Generate test fixtures
      include_fixtures: true
```

### TDD Anchor Coverage

Tester uses TDD anchors to ensure coverage:

```bash
# Check which anchors have tests
ldf tdd status

# Tester will prioritize uncovered anchors
ldf crew dispatch tester
```

---

## reviewer

Reviews generated code for issues, improvements, and best practices.

### When to Use

- After implementation
- Code quality checks
- Independent verification

### Input

- Generated code
- Spec requirements
- Project conventions

### Output

- Review report with issues
- Improvement suggestions
- Security findings

### Command

```bash
ldf crew dispatch reviewer
ldf crew dispatch reviewer --provider openai  # Use different provider for independence
```

### Configuration

```yaml
crew:
  members:
    reviewer:
      # Use different provider for independent review
      provider: openai
      model: gpt-4o
      # Review categories to check
      categories:
        - security
        - performance
        - maintainability
        - style
```

### Review Output

```yaml
# Review result
issues:
  - severity: warning
    category: security
    file: src/auth/service.ts
    line: 45
    message: "Password comparison should use constant-time comparison"
    suggestion: "Use crypto.timingSafeEqual instead of ==="

  - severity: info
    category: maintainability
    file: src/auth/controller.ts
    line: 23
    message: "Consider extracting validation to middleware"

summary:
  critical: 0
  warning: 1
  info: 1
```

## documenter

Generates documentation from code and specs.

### When to Use

- After implementation
- API documentation
- README generation

### Input

- Source code

### Configuration

```yaml
crew:
  members:
    documenter:
      # Output format
      format: markdown  # markdown | jsdoc | openapi
      # Include code examples
      include_examples: true
      # Generate for specific files
      targets:
        - src/api/**/*.ts
```

---

## Custom Crew Members

You can define custom crew members for project-specific tasks.

### Definition

Create a crew member definition in `.ldf/crew/`:

```yaml
# .ldf/crew/migration-writer.yaml
name: migration-writer
description: Generates database migrations from schema changes
role: |
  You are a database migration expert. Generate migrations that:
  - Are reversible (up and down)
  - Handle data transformation safely
  - Follow the project's migration patterns

context:
  - .ldf/specs/*.yaml
  - src/db/schema.ts
  - src/db/migrations/*.ts

output:
  path: src/db/migrations/
  pattern: "{timestamp}-{name}.ts"

config:
  reasoning: high
  max_tokens: 8000
```

### Usage

```bash
ldf crew dispatch migration-writer
```
