# NRRV Phases

NRRV structures development into four distinct phases: **Navigate**, **Reason**, **Realize**, and **Validate**. Each phase has a specific purpose and expected outputs.

## Phase Overview

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│ Navigate │───▶│  Reason  │───▶│ Realize  │───▶│ Validate │
│          │    │          │    │          │    │          │
│  Goals   │    │  Design  │    │  Build   │    │  Verify  │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
```

## Navigate

<Badge text="Phase 1" variant="caution" />

The Navigate phase establishes **direction and requirements**.

### Purpose

- Define what you're trying to accomplish
- Gather requirements and constraints
- Create initial specs

### Activities

<Steps>
1. Initialize a new loop with goals
2. Create or select a spec file
3. Define requirements and acceptance criteria
4. Identify constraints and dependencies
</Steps>

### Commands

```bash
# Start a loop with goals
nrrv loop init --goals "Build user authentication"

# Create a spec
ldf spec create auth-feature --set

# Check phase status
nrrv loop status
```

### Outputs

- Loop initialized with goals
- Spec file created with requirements
- Ready to advance to Reason

### Advancing

```bash
# Move to Reason phase
nrrv phase advance reason
```

The CLI will warn if expected outputs are missing (e.g., no spec file).

---

## Reason

<Badge text="Phase 2" variant="note" />

The Reason phase focuses on **design and decision-making**.

### Purpose

- Design the technical solution
- Make architectural decisions
- Plan the implementation approach

<Aside type="tip">
The Reason phase is where *you* make the important decisions—before AI assistance kicks in during Realize. This ensures you maintain control over the technical direction.
</Aside>

### Activities

<Steps>
1. Review requirements from Navigate
2. Design data models and schemas
3. Choose technologies and patterns
4. Define API contracts
5. Plan testing strategy
</Steps>

### Commands

```bash
# Check current phase
nrrv loop status

# Update spec with technical details
ldf spec edit

# Advance when ready
nrrv phase advance realize
```

### Outputs

- Technical design documented in spec
- Architecture decisions made
- Implementation plan defined

### Decision Points

During Reason, document these decisions:

| Decision | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Data storage | PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM |
| API style | REST with JSON responses |
| Auth approach | JWT with refresh tokens |
| Error handling | Structured error objects |
| Testing | Jest unit tests + Supertest integration |

---

## Realize

<Badge text="Phase 3" variant="success" />

The Realize phase is where **AI-assisted implementation** happens.

### Purpose

- Build the solution with AI assistance
- Generate code, tests, and documentation
- Capture learnings for future reference

### SAIL Execution

Within Realize, the SAIL framework structures AI assistance:

```
┌─────────┐    ┌───────────┐    ┌───────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│  Scope  │───▶│ Architect │───▶│ Implement │───▶│  Learn  │
└─────────┘    └───────────┘    └───────────┘    └─────────┘
```

1. **Scope**: Extract requirements into user stories and TDD anchors
2. **Architect**: Generate technical design artifacts
3. **Implement**: Dispatch crew members to generate code
4. **Learn**: Document what was learned

### Commands

```bash
# Run SAIL phases
ldf sail scope complete
ldf sail architect complete
ldf crew dispatch coder
ldf sail learn complete

# Check SAIL status
ldf sail status
```

### Crew Dispatch

Crew members are specialized AI agents:

```bash
# Dispatch the coder
ldf crew dispatch coder

# Check dispatch status
ldf crew status
```

See [Crew System](/crew/overview/) for details.

### Outputs

- Generated source code
- Unit and integration tests
- Documentation updates
- Captured learnings

---

## Validate

<Badge text="Phase 4" variant="tip" />

The Validate phase **verifies quality** before completing the loop.

### Purpose

- Run tests and verify correctness
- Check code quality with guardrails
- Review and approve changes
- Complete the loop with an outcome

### Activities

<Steps>
1. Run automated tests
2. Execute guardrail checks
3. Review generated code
4. Fix any issues
5. Complete the loop
</Steps>

### Commands

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run guardrails
ldf guardrails check src/

# Complete the loop
nrrv loop complete --outcome continue
```

### Guardrails

Guardrails are automated quality checks:

```bash
# Check specific files
ldf guardrails check src/auth/

# Check with specific rules
ldf guardrails check --rules security,style src/
```

See [Guardrails](/framework/guardrails/) for details.

### Loop Outcomes

When completing a loop, choose an outcome:

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `continue` | Success—proceed with next work |
| `adjust` | Partial success—minor changes needed |
| `pivot` | Significant issues—major direction change |

```bash
nrrv loop complete --outcome continue
```

---

## Phase Transitions

### Valid Transitions

Phases must be advanced in order:

```
navigate → reason → realize → validate → (loop complete)
```

You cannot skip phases or go backwards.

### Transition Signals

Each transition emits a signal:

```yaml
signal_type: lifecycle.phase_transition
timestamp: "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
actor: "dev@example.com"
source: nrrv
payload:
  from_phase: reason
  to_phase: realize
```

### Transition Warnings

The CLI may warn if expected outputs are missing:

```bash
$ nrrv phase advance reason
⚠️  Warning: No spec file found
Continue anyway? [y/N]
```

You can acknowledge warnings and proceed:

```bash
nrrv phase advance reason --force
```

This creates a waiver signal for audit purposes.

---

## Phase Durations

There's no enforced time limit on phases. However, signals record timestamps, allowing you to analyze how long each phase takes:

```bash
# View loop with timing
nrrv loop status --verbose
```

```
Loop #5 — validate
Started: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z
Current Duration: 4h 30m

Phase Durations:
  navigate: 45m
  reason: 1h 20m
  realize: 2h 15m (SAIL)
  validate: 10m (current)
```
