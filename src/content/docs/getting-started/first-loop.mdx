# Your First Loop

This tutorial walks you through a complete NRRV development loop, from navigation to validation. We'll build a simple TODO API as an example.

## The Four Phases

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <div style="padding: 1rem; background: #fef3c7; border-radius: 8px;">
    <strong>1. Navigate</strong><br/>
    Define goals and gather requirements
  </div>
  <div style="padding: 1rem; background: #dbeafe; border-radius: 8px;">
    <strong>2. Reason</strong><br/>
    Design solutions and make decisions
  </div>
  <div style="padding: 1rem; background: #d1fae5; border-radius: 8px;">
    <strong>3. Realize</strong><br/>
    Build with AI assistance (SAIL)
  </div>
  <div style="padding: 1rem; background: #ede9fe; border-radius: 8px;">
    <strong>4. Validate</strong><br/>
    Test and verify quality
  </div>
</div>

## Phase 1: Navigate

<Steps>
1. **Start a new loop:**
   ```bash
   nrrv loop init --goals "Build a TODO API with CRUD operations"
   ```

2. **Confirm you're in Navigate phase:**
   ```bash
   nrrv loop status
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Loop #1 — navigate
   Goals: Build a TODO API with CRUD operations
   Started: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z
   ```

3. **Create your spec:**
   ```bash
   ldf spec create todo-api --set
   ```

4. **Advance to Reason phase:**
   ```bash
   nrrv phase advance reason
   ```
</Steps>

## Phase 2: Reason

In the Reason phase, you design your solution.

<Steps>
1. **Review your spec and add technical details:**
   - Database schema
   - API endpoints
   - Error handling approach
   - Testing strategy

2. **Advance to Realize phase:**
   ```bash
   nrrv phase advance realize
   ```
</Steps>

<Aside>
The Reason phase is where you make architectural decisions *before* AI assistance kicks in. This ensures you maintain control over the technical direction.
</Aside>

## Phase 3: Realize (SAIL)

The Realize phase uses SAIL for AI-assisted implementation.

### Scope
```bash
ldf sail scope complete
```

This dispatches the **scope** crew member to:
- Extract formal requirements
- Create user stories
- Define TDD anchors (test specifications)

### Architect
```bash
ldf sail architect complete
```

This dispatches the **architect** crew member to:
- Design technical architecture
- Define component structure
- Plan implementation approach

### Implement
```bash
ldf crew dispatch coder
```

This dispatches the **coder** crew member to:
- Generate implementation code
- Write tests
- Create documentation

### Learn
```bash
ldf sail learn complete
```

This captures learnings from the implementation for future reference.

## Phase 4: Validate

<Steps>
1. **Advance to Validate phase:**
   ```bash
   nrrv phase advance validate
   ```

2. **Run your tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Run guardrail checks:**
   ```bash
   ldf guardrails check src/
   ```

4. **Complete the loop:**
   ```bash
   nrrv loop complete
   ```
</Steps>

## View Loop Summary

After completing the loop:

```bash
nrrv loop status
```

Output:
```
Loop #1 — completed
Goals: Build a TODO API with CRUD operations
Duration: 2h 15m
Phases: navigate → reason → realize → validate ✓
Signals: 24 emitted
```
