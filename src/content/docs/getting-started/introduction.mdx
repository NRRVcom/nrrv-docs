# Introduction to NRRV

NRRV is a development lifecycle framework that brings structure and traceability to AI-assisted software development. It stands for **Navigate**, **Reason**, **Realize**, and **Validate** — four phases that guide you from initial requirements to validated, production-ready code.

## Why NRRV?

AI coding assistants are powerful, but using them effectively at scale requires:

- **Structure**: Clear phases prevent scope creep and ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Traceability**: Signals track every decision, making audits and debugging easier
- **Quality**: Built-in guardrails catch issues before they become problems
- **Learning**: Captured insights improve future development cycles

<Aside type="tip">
NRRV is framework-agnostic. It works with any tech stack, any AI provider, and any team size.

## Core Concepts

### Loops

A **loop** is a complete development cycle through all four NRRV phases. Each loop has:

- A unique loop ID
- Clear goals defined at the start
- Signals emitted at each phase transition
- A completion summary with metrics

### Signals

**Signals** are immutable events that record everything that happens during development:

```yaml
# Example: Phase transition signal
signal_type: lifecycle.phase_transition
timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
actor: "developer@example.com"
payload:
  from_phase: navigate
  to_phase: reason
```

All derived state (YAML files, dashboards) is computed from signals, making the signal log the source of truth.

### SAIL Execution

Within the **Realize** phase, **SAIL** provides AI-assisted implementation:

  <Card title="Scope">
    Extract requirements, user stories, and TDD anchors from your spec.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Architect">
    Design the technical approach with AI assistance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Implement">
    Generate code using crew members (LLM agents with specific roles).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learn">
    Document what was learned for future reference.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Two CLIs

NRRV provides two command-line tools:

| CLI | Purpose | Key Commands |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| `nrrv` | Loop lifecycle management | `loop init`, `phase advance` |
| `ldf` | SAIL execution & crew dispatch | `sail`, `crew dispatch` |
