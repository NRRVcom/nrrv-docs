# Quick Start

Get up and running with NRRV in 5 minutes. By the end, you'll have a project with a spec file ready for AI-assisted development.

## Create a New Project

<Steps>
1. **Initialize your project directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-project && cd my-project
   git init
   ```

2. **Initialize NRRV:**
   ```bash
   nrrv loop init
   ```

   This creates the `.nrrv/` directory structure for tracking loops.

3. **Initialize LDF:**
   ```bash
   ldf init
   ```

   This creates the `.ldf/` directory for specs and settings.

4. **Create your first spec:**
   ```bash
   ldf spec create --set
   ```

   This opens your editor with a spec template. Fill in your requirements.
</Steps>

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
my-project/
├── .nrrv/
│   ├── loop.yaml          # Current loop state
│   └── signals/           # Signal log directory
├── .ldf/
│   ├── settings.yaml      # LDF configuration
│   └── specs/             # Your spec files
└── .gitignore
```

## Your First Spec

A minimal spec looks like this:

```yaml
# .ldf/specs/feature-001.yaml
title: "Add user authentication"
description: |
  Implement basic user authentication with email/password.

requirements:
  - Users can sign up with email and password
  - Users can log in with credentials
  - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
  - JWT tokens are issued on successful login

acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] Sign up endpoint returns 201 on success
  - [ ] Login endpoint returns JWT token
  - [ ] Invalid credentials return 401
```

## Run SAIL Phases

Once you have a spec, run through the SAIL phases:

```bash
# Scope: Extract requirements and TDD anchors
ldf crew dispatch scope

# Architect: Design the technical approach
ldf crew dispatch architect

# Implement: Generate code
ldf crew dispatch coder

# Learn: Document what was learned
ldf sail learn complete
```

<Aside type="tip">
Use `--dry-run` to see what would happen without making LLM calls:
```bash
ldf crew dispatch scope --dry-run
```
</Aside>

## Check Status

View your current state at any time:

```bash
# Loop status
nrrv loop status

# SAIL phase status
ldf sail status
```
