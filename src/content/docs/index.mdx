## What is NRRV?

NRRV (Navigate, Reason, Realize, Validate) is a development lifecycle framework designed for AI-assisted software development. It provides structure, traceability, and quality assurance through every phase of development.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Navigate" icon="compass">
    Define goals, gather requirements, and set direction for development work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reason" icon="puzzle">
    Design solutions, make architectural decisions, and plan implementation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Realize" icon="rocket">
    Build the solution with AI assistance using the SAIL execution framework.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validate" icon="approve-check">
    Verify quality, run tests, and ensure the work meets requirements.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## SAIL: AI-Assisted Implementation

Within the Realize phase, **SAIL** (Scope, Architect, Implement, Learn) provides a structured approach for AI-assisted development:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Scope" icon="document">
    Define requirements, user stories, and TDD anchors.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Architect" icon="setting">
    Design system architecture and technical approach.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Implement" icon="laptop">
    Write code with AI crew members (LLM-powered agents).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learn" icon="star">
    Document learnings and create knowledge artifacts.
  </Card>
