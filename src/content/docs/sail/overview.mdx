# SAIL Overview

**SAIL** (Scope, Architect, Implement, Learn) is the AI-assisted implementation framework used during the NRRV Realize phase.

## What Is SAIL?

SAIL structures how AI assists with software development:

```
┌──────────┐    ┌───────────┐    ┌───────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│   Scope  │───▶│ Architect │───▶│ Implement │───▶│  Learn  │
│          │    │           │    │           │    │         │
│ Extract  │    │  Design   │    │  Generate │    │ Capture │
│ reqs     │    │  approach │    │  code     │    │ insight │
└──────────┘    └───────────┘    └───────────┘    └─────────┘
```

Each phase has a specific purpose:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Scope" icon="document">
    Extract formal requirements, user stories, and TDD anchors from your spec.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Architect" icon="setting">
    Design the technical architecture and implementation approach.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Implement" icon="laptop">
    Generate code, tests, and documentation using crew members.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learn" icon="star">
    Capture insights and learnings for future reference.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## SAIL in the NRRV Lifecycle

SAIL operates within the **Realize** phase of NRRV:

```
NRRV Phases:   Navigate ──▶ Reason ──▶ Realize ──▶ Validate
                                          │
                                          ▼
                              ┌─────────────────────┐
                              │       SAIL          │
                              │ Scope → Architect → │
                              │ Implement → Learn   │
                              └─────────────────────┘
```

<Aside type="tip">
You should only enter the Realize phase after completing Navigate (requirements) and Reason (design decisions). SAIL works best when it has clear context from earlier phases.
</Aside>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
1. **Ensure you're in Realize phase:**
   ```bash
   nrrv loop status
   # Should show: Loop #N — realize
   ```

2. **Run SAIL phases in order:**
   ```bash
   ldf sail scope complete
   ldf sail architect complete
   ldf crew dispatch coder
   ldf sail learn complete
   ```

3. **Check progress:**
   ```bash
   ldf sail status
   ```
</Steps>

## SAIL Commands

### Phase Execution

```bash
# Complete a SAIL phase
ldf sail scope complete
ldf sail architect complete
ldf sail learn complete

# The implement phase uses crew dispatch
ldf crew dispatch coder
```

### Status

```bash
# View SAIL status
ldf sail status
```

Output:
```
SAIL Status — auth-feature spec
  ✓ scope      complete  (2m 15s)
  ✓ architect  complete  (3m 42s)
  ⋯ implement  in progress
  ○ learn      pending
```

### Dry Run

Preview what would happen without making LLM calls:

```bash
ldf sail scope complete --dry-run
```

## Phase Dependencies

SAIL phases have soft dependencies:

| Phase | Depends On | Produces |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Scope | Spec file | User stories, TDD anchors |
| Architect | Scope output | Technical design |
| Implement | Architect output | Code, tests |
| Learn | Implement results | Knowledge artifacts |

You can run phases out of order, but you'll get warnings:

```bash
$ ldf sail architect complete
⚠️  Warning: Scope phase not completed
Architect phase may produce suboptimal results without scope artifacts.
Continue anyway? [y/N]
```

## Crew Members

During the Implement phase, **crew members** do the actual code generation:

```bash
# Dispatch the coder crew member
ldf crew dispatch coder

# Dispatch with specific options
ldf crew dispatch coder --reasoning high --spec auth-feature
```

Crew members are specialized AI agents with defined roles:

| Crew Member | Role |
|-------------|------|
| `scope` | Requirements extraction |
| `architect` | Technical design |
| `coder` | Code generation |
| `tester` | Test generation |
| `reviewer` | Code review |

See [Crew System](/crew/overview/) for details.

## Artifacts

SAIL phases produce artifacts stored in `.ldf/sail/`:

```
.ldf/
├── sail/
│   ├── scope/
│   │   ├── user-stories.yaml
│   │   └── tdd-anchors.yaml
│   ├── architect/
│   │   ├── design.md
│   │   └── components.yaml
│   └── learn/
│       └── learnings.yaml
└── specs/
    └── auth-feature.yaml
```

## Signals

SAIL execution emits signals for tracking:

```yaml
signal_type: sail.phase_complete
timestamp: "2024-01-15T11:30:00Z"
source: ldf
payload:
  phase: scope
  spec: "auth-feature"
  build_status: success
  crew_members_used:
    - scope
  learnings:
    - "Identified 5 user stories from requirements"
```

Crew dispatch signals track individual operations:

```yaml
signal_type: crew.dispatch_completed
payload:
  dispatch_id: "d-abc123"
  crew_member: coder
  spec: "auth-feature"
  phase: implement
  result:
    status: success
    duration_ms: 45230
  tokens:
    input: 8500
    output: 3200
    total: 11700
  artifacts_produced:
    - path: "src/auth/service.ts"
      type: typescript
      lines: 145
```

## Configuration

Configure SAIL behavior in `.ldf/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
sail:
  default_spec: "current"  # Use active spec

  scope:
    auto_tdd: true         # Generate TDD anchors

  architect:
    include_diagrams: true  # Generate architecture diagrams

  implement:
    default_crew:
      - coder
      - tester

  learn:
    auto_capture: true     # Automatically capture learnings
```

## Best Practices

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Complete Phases in Order">
    While you can skip phases, each builds on the previous. Scope provides context for Architect, which guides Implement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review AI Output">
    SAIL generates artifacts, but you should review them. The Learn phase is a good time to document what worked and what didn't.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Dry Run First">
    For complex specs, use `--dry-run` to see what would happen before committing to LLM calls.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Capture Learnings">
    The Learn phase improves future iterations. Don't skip it.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
